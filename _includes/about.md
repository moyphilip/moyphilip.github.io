Hello, my name is Philip Moy and I enjoy analyzing data on my spare time. I like to learn more about machine learning and really appreciate pretty data visualizations.

I currently reside in Queens, NY as a data analyst for New York City's Department of Finance. 
When I am not analyzing data on my free time I am exercising, playing/watching sports, or traveling.

Feel free to contact me for anything data or non-data related!
